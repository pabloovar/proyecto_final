  abstract        = {Most FDA-approved adjuvants for infectious agents boost humoral but not cellular immunity, and have poorly-understood mechanisms. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING, also known as MITA, MPYS, or ERIS) is an exciting adjuvant target due to its role in cyclic dinucleotide (CDN)-driven anti-viral immunity; however, a major hindrance is STING's cytosolic localization which requires intracellular delivery of its agonists. As a result, STING agonists administered in a soluble form have elicited suboptimal immune responses. Delivery of STING agonists via particle platforms has proven a more successful strategy, but the opportunity for improved formulations and bioactivity remains. In this study we evaluated the adjuvant activity of the potent STING agonist, CDN 3'3'-cGAMP (cGAMP), encapsulated in acid-sensitive acetalated dextran (Ace-DEX) polymeric microparticles (MPs) which passively target antigen-presenting cells for intracellular release. This formulation was superior to all particle delivery systems evaluated and maintained its bioactivity following a sterilizing dose of gamma irradiation. Compared to soluble cGAMP, the Ace-DEX cGAMP MPs enhanced type-I interferon responses nearly 1000-fold in vitro and 50-fold in vivo, caused up to a 10 -fold boost in antibody titers, increased Th1-associated responses, and expanded germinal center B cells and memory T cells. Furthermore, the encapsulated cGAMP elicited no observable toxicity in animals and achieved protective immunity against a lethal influenza challenge seven months post-immunization when using CDN adjuvant doses up to 100-fold lower than previous reports. For these reasons, Ace-DEX MP-encapsulated cGAMP represents a potent vaccine adjuvant of humoral and cellular immunity.},

Prevention of infectious diseases by vaccines is among the most effective healthcare measures mainly for these subjects. However immunocompromised people vary in their degree of immunosuppression and susceptibility to infection and, therefore, represent a heterogeneous population with regard to immunization. To date there is no well- established evidence for use of vaccines in immunodeficient patients, and indications are not clearly defined even in high-quality reviews and in most of the guidelines prepared to provide recommendations for the active vaccination of immunocompromised hosts. The aim of this document is to issue recommendations based on published literature and the collective experience of the Italian primary immunodeficiency centers, about how and when vaccines can be used in immunocompromised patients, in order to facilitate physician decisions and to ensure the best immune protection with the lowest risk to the health of the patient.},

  abstract        = {Influenza vaccine containing an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant (MF-59) may lead to greater immunogenicity in organ transplant recipients. However, alloimmunization may be a concern with adjuvanted vaccines. We conducted a randomized trial comparing the safety and immunogenicity of adjuvanted versus nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine in adult kidney transplant patients. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 2012 to 2013 influenza vaccine with or without MF59 adjuvant. Preimmunization and postimmunization sera underwent strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition assay. HLA alloantibody was determined by Luminex single-antigen bead assay. We randomized 68 patients and 60 (29 nonadjuvanted; 31 adjuvanted) had complete samples available at follow-up. Seroconversion to at least 1 of 3 influenza antigens was present in 71.0% versus 55.2% in adjuvanted versus nonadjuvanted vaccine respectively (P = 0.21). Geometric mean titers and seroprotection rates were similar between groups. Seroconversion rates were especially low in those on MMF of 2 g or greater daily (44.4% vs 71.4%; P = 0.047). In the subgroup of patients 18 to 64 years old, seroconversion was significantly greater with adjuvanted vaccine (odds ratio, 6.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-28.6). There were no increases in HLA alloantibodies in patients who received adjuvanted vaccine. Adjuvanted vaccine was safe and had similar immunogenicity to standard vaccine in the overall transplant cohort but did show a potential immunogenicity benefit for the 18 to 64 years age group.},

  abstract        = {The single radial immunodiffusion (SRID) assay, used to quantify hemagglutinin (HA) in influenza vaccines, requires reference reagents; however, because centralized production of reference reagents may slow the emergency deployment of vaccines, alternatives are needed. We investigated the production of HA proteins using recombinant DNA technology, rather than a traditional egg-based production process. The HA proteins were then used in an SRID assay as a reference antigen. We found that HA can be quantified in both egg-based and cell-based influenza vaccines when recombinant HAs (rHAs) are used as the reference antigen. Furthermore, we confirmed that rHAs obtained from strains with pandemic potential, such as H5N1, H7N3, H7N9, and H9N2 strains, can be utilized in the SRID assay. The rHA production process takes just one month, in contrast to the traditional process that takes three to four months. The use of rHAs may reduce the time required to produce reference reagents and facilitate timely introduction of vaccines during emergencies.},

Prolonged exposure to silica can lead to the development of silicosis, an irreversible, fibrotic pulmonary disease. The mechanisms by which silica and other crystals activate immune cells are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that silica and aluminum salt crystals activated inflammasomes formed by the cytoplasmic receptor NALP3. NALP3 activation required phagocytosis of crystals, and this uptake subsequently led to lysosomal damage and rupture. 'Sterile' lysosomal damage (without crystals) also induced NALP3 activation, and inhibition of either phagosomal acidification or cathepsin B activity impaired NALP3 activation. Our results indicate that the NALP3 inflammasome senses lysosomal damage as an endogenous 'danger' signal.},
